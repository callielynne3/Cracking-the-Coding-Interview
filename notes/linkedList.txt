Wiki Definition: 
  A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references.

CCI Definition: 
  A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked list. each node
  points to the next node in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next
  node and the previous node. 
  Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list.
  This means that if you'd like to find the Kth element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements.
  The benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant
  time.

• Node Class:
  • The Node class contains two properties, value, to store the node's data, and nexNode to store a link to the next node in the linked list:

  function Node(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.nextNode = null;
  }

• Linked List Class:
  • Here we add the functionality for a linked list. We have to include functions that will be able to insert, remove or delete nodes, as well as finding data values in the list: 

  function LinkedList() {
    this.head = new Node("head"); //points null to the first element inserted
    this.find = find;
    this.insert = insert;
    this.remove = remove;
    this.display = display;
  }

• Manipulating a Linked List:
  • Node Insertion:
    First we need a helper function that searches through the linked list looking for specified data, when this data is found, the function returns the node storing the data. This function is also a good example of moving through a linked list.
    The function is built as follows.
    Create a new node and assign it as the head node.
    Loop through the linked list, from one node to the next when the current node's property is not equal to the data we are looking for.
    When this data is found return the node storing the data.
    If the data isn't found return null.
    The insert function:

    function find(item) {
      var currentNode = this.head;
      while (current.element != item) {
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
      }
      return currentNode;
    }
    
  • Singly Linked List

      function Node(element) {
        this.element = element;
        this.next = null;
      }

      function LList() {
        this.head = new Node("head");
        this.find = find;
        this.insert = insert;
        this.display = display;
      }

      function find(item) {
      var currNode = this.head;
      while (currNode.element != item) {
            currNode = currNode.next;
         }
      return currNode;
      }

      function insert(newElement, item) {
        var newNode = new Node(newElement);
        var current = this.find(item);
        newNode.next = current.next;
        current.next = newNode;
      }

      function display() {
      var currNode = this.head;
      while (currNode.next !== null) {
            console.log(currNode.next.element);
            currNode = currNode.next;
         }
      }

      var cities = new LList();
      cities.insert("Seattle", "head");
      cities.insert("Portland", "Seattle");
      cities.insert("Boulder", "Portland");
      cities.display();
