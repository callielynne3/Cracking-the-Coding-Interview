# String Compression: 

# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

def compress_str(str)
  original_length = str.length
  compressed = ""
  compressed_length = 0

  count = 1
  original_length.times do |i|
    if str[i] == str[i+1]
      count += 1
    else
      compressed += str[i] + count.to_s
      compressed_length += 2
      count = 1
    end

    return str if compressed_length >= original_length
  end

  return compressed
